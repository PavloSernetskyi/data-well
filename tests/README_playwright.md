# ðŸ§ª Playwright UI Testing â€“ DataWell MVP

This project includes automated **UI testing** using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to validate the full user flow for submitting health and lifestyle data.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- [x] Playwright test environment setup (`@playwright/test`)
- [x] Custom test config (`playwright.config.ts`)
- [x] Form submission test (`tests/form.spec.ts`)
- [x] Output auto-saved in `/test-results/`
- [x] Clean `.gitignore` to exclude results from Git tracking

##  How to Set Up Testing

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Install Playwright and browsers**
```bash
npm install -D playwright
npx playwright install
```

##  Run the UI Test
